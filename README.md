At that time I realized that I was fond of English. I was always good at English at school. And when we got acquainted wi
th the English and American literatur
e, the lessons of British and American Studies I understood 
that I want to have a perfect command of the English language 
and become a good specialist in English.

So I do my best to master the language because I have made up my mind to apply t
o the Linguistic University and become either a teacher or an interpreter. I haven't chosen it yet. 
Both professions are interesting and necessary in our society. Perhaps,
I'll keep our family tradition and become a teacher of English. But I'll think about it tomorrow if I enter the University.
